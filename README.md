## 📚 Repository Structure

This repository contains five subpackages, each demonstrating different aspects and capabilities of LangGraph:

1. 📊 `graph1_hello_odsc`: A simple introduction to LangGraph basics
2. ⚡ `graph2_async_execution`: Exploring asynchronous execution in LangGraph
3. 🌳 `graph3_conditional_branch`: Implementing conditional branching in your agent's logic
4. 🧩 `graph4`: Advanced LangGraph techniques and patterns

## 🎯 Session Goals

By the end of this hands-on session, you will:
- Understand the fundamentals of LangGraph
- Be able to create basic and advanced graph structures for AI agents
- Implement asynchronous and conditional logic in your agents
- Gain practical experience in building flexible and powerful AI workflows

## 🛠️ Getting Started (IDE, not Colab)

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/emarco177/langgraph-odsc.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd langgraph-odsc
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   poetry install
   ```

## 📘 Session Outline

1. 🎤 Introduction: Why use LangGraph for GenAI agents?
2. 🔍 Exploring the basics with `graph1_hello_odsc`
3. ⏱️ Asynchronous execution deep dive using `graph2_async_execution`
4. 🔀 Implementing decision-making with `graph3_conditional_branch`
5. 🏗️ Advanced patterns and techniques in `graph4`
6. 🛠️ Hands-on coding session
7. 🤔 Q&A and discussion

## 🧪 Running the Examples

Each subpackage contains its own `main.py` or a `.ipynb` file. To run an example:

1. Navigate to the subpackage directory:
   ```
   cd graph1_hello_odsc
   ```
2. Run the main script:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```

For Jupyter Notebook examples (`.ipynb` files), use Jupyter or Google Colab to open and run the notebooks.
